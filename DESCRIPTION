Description: Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) was developed to create a consistent description of gene 
    products with disease perspectives, and is essential for supporting functional 
    genomics in disease context. Accurate disease descriptions can discover new 
    relationships between genes and disease, and new functions for previous 
    uncharacteried genes and alleles.We have developed the 
    [DOSE](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DOSE/) package for semantic 
    similarity analysis and disease enrichment analysis, and `DOSE` import an 
    Bioconductor package 'DO.db' to get the relationship(such as parent and child)
    between MPO terms. But `DO.db`  hasn't been updated for years, and a lot of 
    semantic information is [missing](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/DOSE/issues/57). 
    So we developed the new package `HPO.db` for Human Human Phenotype Ontology annotation.
